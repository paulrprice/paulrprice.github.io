**About**  
I am an independent researcher focused on relating climate change science to climate action policy. In  particular, I look at national (and EU) level, to assess progress relative to equitable achievement of the Paris Agreement temperature goal. This means I have to be a generalist, with  aworking knowledge of all areas of societal activity â€“ energy (electricity, transport, heating), industry, agriculture, and land use. Thus I look at how these sectoral impacts "add up", in fact and in the context of effective society-wide climate action. My previous career as a structural carpenter usefully helps me think in terms of delivering the agreed necessary outcomes within input quantity limits, which I think this is a much more useful evidence basis for assessing our shared future rather than the standard "feasibility" basis in notional economic costs where the benefits of action are often ignored.
